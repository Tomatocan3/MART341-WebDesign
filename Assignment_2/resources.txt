3,Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
  Yes, Instagram. I love art and typically drawing with any tools. Instagram recognize what I am usually looking for, they offer me opportunities to see the drawing art I've never seen and the cycle of Instagram is so fast that give me some ideas. I know Instagram kills the understanding of essence,so If I find my favorite arts, I allways go to the artist website and check who write this and who is he/she/they.
