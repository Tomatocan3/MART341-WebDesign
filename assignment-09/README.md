1, I only learned python before I took this class and my python skill is elementally level. but once I understand how codes are working, it became easy.
  However, html and css run everything at the same time, so I sometimes needed to check my entire codes to find one single wrong code. Making a website is so fun because I feel doing LEGO. I wish I know the every code in HTML and CSS.

2, I forgot basic staffs because I did not touch the HTML and CSS. I must restudy:(
