1. I will make a web site that show my works of art. I took drawing class last semester and
I'm taking sculpture class. I have 2 semester amount of works. I want to have an opportunity to show my works to public.
My works are not good quality but I want to.

2. The importance of responsive web design is that it offers an optimized browsing experience.
